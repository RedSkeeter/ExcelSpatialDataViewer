======================

Preview spatial data in an Excel spreadsheet.

One day I needed to archive some data that was stored in spreadsheets.  The data contained Lat/Lon coordinates.  Where I archived the data was dependent on where the spatial data came from geographically.  Since Excel can't show you a map of the coordinates I needed to write a simple tool to ingest the data from the spreadsheet, identify the coordinates and show them on a map.
